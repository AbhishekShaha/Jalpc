Gita is a powerful framework of ideas but it introduces hundreds of Sanskrit terms that are alien to western world. Even for Hindi speaking populace, most of these evoke mixed connotations as they have been used in different contexts across rich Indian mythological literature. I say this from my own experience. Before listening to Gita, I misconstrued Karma. I thought Karma as any activity. 

> A word about this post -  This attempt is NOT exhaustive. Rather a running notebook of my interpretations. I can't guarantee this to be a final version nor do I claim accuracy but I do make an attempt to interweave the framework through definitions.  As long as reader appreciates that natural languages have limited abstraction. And be careful with their own imagination, I think this post will be somewhat useful. That said, Gita is experiential. Reading it is analogous to learning swimming by reading.  

# `Shraddha` (The Faith - The source of Manifestatioin)

Faith is a belief that is not based on scientific proof . For example, we don't need faith in Einstein to trust the Theory of Relativity. We don't need faith in Math for it is pure logic. But we need faith in God if we want to believe in him. `Shraddha` is slightly different , for  faith has a tinge of authority. If not full authority at least an equal footing. You have faith in a master or a friend. `Shraddha` is bit more devotional and less demanding. Unlike faith, it can change. Its NOT set in stone. In fact, it changes quite frequently. 
	
> A word on mindless comparisons - Science v/s God- How many of us understand Relativity? Or Quantum Mechanics ? But most of us trust someone else who has seen the scientific proof. Isn't it faith in that someone? This means we can extend definition of scientific proof to something that we ourself have proved mathematically or someone did that. Someone who we trust. That someone could be a teacher, a friend or a book. Another characteristic of this mechanism is that the proof must be  available in open domain.  If we are willing to invest our time, we should be allowed to verify the proof on our own. But that  isn't that true about spirituality as well ?  Books like Gita and Bible tell us that that there exists something beyond physical.  And we  can find one (ourselves) if we are willing to invest our time. Then where is the conflict ?. Another common difference is that science has experimental proofs. So does spirituality. There is proven healing impact of meditation and breathing. People cure and endure through faith. Bottom line - comparisons are misplaced. Don't really serve any purpose. On the contrary, We know for sure that science continuously  evolves . Einstein proved Newton was wrong and later changed his own theory. Quantum Mechanics is still at odds with classical science. Does that mean that we can't have absolute trust in science? Or should we say we have faith in science?

The scripture says humans are made out of `Shraddha`. We are what we believe in. We manifest our faith. The physicality around us is a creation of our faith. As said in chapter 17 verse 3 of Gita.

[Translation](http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/Gita/verse-17-03.html)
The faith of everyone comes according to the perceptions of the mind. The living personality is the embodiment of faith, one is identified by , whatever faith one has. 

Obviously, there is no mathematical proof here but the framework appears compelling. I see it in my own experiences. And in experiences of many around me. We do science only if we have faith in science. We run if we have faith in running. We live if we have faith in life. In essence, faith is the root. Not the other way around.

	We don't develop faith in things. We develop things because of faith.

But the question is still open  - Where does this faith come from?

# `Atma` (The Unmanifested.)
Gita says `Atma` is something that doesn't die. Fire can't burn it, Water can't wet it. In essence, it is beyond the physical realm. What is it then ? Well `Atma` is NOTHING in physical parlance for it is unmanifested. But it has potential to manifest. In fact, it is the only thing that can manifest. A close comparison would be electricity. Electricity can manifest into fans, cars, refrigerators or thousands of other gadgets. Without electricity, they are all dead. We can't dry the current or wet it. Nor can we burn it. It doesn't die or takes birth. Its just there. Motion of electrons are everywhere. It sits there unmanifested but has potential to manifest. Unlimited potential. 
# Karma (The Action of free will)
Gita gives humans highest degree of free will though our free will is slave to our faith. We do have intelligence to reshape our action to a certain degree which in turn mutates our faith. Karma is the action of free will (not that driven by pre existing faith). Though we have a little wiggle room to fit in Karma, it still is order of magnitude higher than most other species. In essence Karma changes our faith (ever so slowly) and hence our manifestation. The bandwidth of change for animals is extremely limited and that of insects is even less. The actions driven entirely through faith are called `Swdharma` and the actions of free will are known as `Karma`. Thus `Karma` is something that you won't do involuntarily. Depending on what Karma manifests into , Gita defines three types of Karmas  - `Satvik` - That leads to internal development and  happiness. `Rajas` - That leads to external growth, conflict and  chase, and lastly `Tamas` - That leads to lust, consumption and lethargy. As said earlier, these karmas will slowly shape your faith. Over indulgence in `Tamasik Karmas` will make you lethargic and consumer. Similarly `Satvik` Karma will make you interested in pursuit of knowledge and happiness.  It appears to an untrained eye that we should indulge in `Satvik Karma`. But Gita says that we want to reach a stage where none of these  are playing. Such karma is called **Nishkam Karma**. This is what leads 'to' ultimate exit. 

`Nishkam` means something without any expectation. `Satvik` , `Rajas` as well as `Tamas` actions, all have an expectation tied to it. In fact anything you do beyond `swadharma` must have a solid incentive for change. Why else would you do it? Thus desires lead to `Karma` (good or bad). Accordingly the faith changes (good or bad). And `Prakriti` continues to further complex our lives. `Nishkam Karma` (a deed that's neither `Swadhrma` nor done out of any desire) stabilizes the growth. And as volume of `Nishkam` increases in your faith, manifestation starts receding. Basically you changed your self to a state of no longing. That means your manifestation is no manifestation. Which leads to discovery of your self `Atma`. Since you are in a state without desires, you are beyond mental gratification or pain. . 

# Death (Change of Clothes)

I don't think that anyone contests the fact that during our lifetime our actions are governed by our faith and in turn they slowly maneuver our faith in certain direction. The debate really starts at "what happens at death" . This is where Gita is very different from rest of the scriptures. Gita doesn't impart death more weight than a sleep cycle. The purpose of physical body is to carry the leftover faith from unbalanced `karma` 
# Maya (The web of Manifestation )
Krishna (our own evolved self - Atma) goes a step further. He says that I stem your faith in whatever you want to follow.  This makes sense. We have faith in our parents. In our teachers. Why? Cuz we are designed to trust without reason  and create a reality from our blind trust. It continues as we age. We all do different things. Cuz we all have faith in different ways of lively hood. There are infinite possibilities of our being. Diversity is created by our ability to have faith in different courses of life. Scripture names this diversity 'Maya' (Matrix).

Krishna also says that though I stem your faith and get you whatever you place your faith in, but this is the cause of all miseries. For, the outcomes never last. The source of eternal pleasure and exit from matrix is in entrusting your faith in Krishna (our own evolved self - Atma). The idea is again simple. If you don't put faith in any of the worldly artifacts, you will not manifest the Matrix. And hence you will be able to enrich your own self (Atma) to an extent that your Atma becomes a super soul ( Parmatma). A connected state that is in eternal equilibrium across endless manifestations.

If this all was that simple, then why are we not entrusting our faith in our Atma alone? That is cuz the matrix has strong temptations. It pulls you in through four key tools on its disposal - Kama (desires), Krodha (Anger), Lobha (greed), Moha (Love). And fifth being the confusions created by Maya (Matrix) itself. These five basic culprits, move your faith into endless series of activities. Each time accomplishing something temporal. And pain follows at the end. Be it relationships, careers, science, arts or sports - there is always an end and its always miserable.
