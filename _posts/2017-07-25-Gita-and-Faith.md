Gita is a powerful framework of ideas but it introduces hundreds of Sanskrit terms that are alien to western world. Even for Hindi speaking populace, most of these evoke mixed connotations as they have been used in different contexts across rich Indian mythological sphere. I say this from my own experience. Before listening to Gita, I misconstrued Karma. I thought Karma as any activity. 

> A word about this post -  This attempt is NOT exhaustive. Rather a running notebook of my interpretations. I can't guarantee this to be a final version nor do I claim accuracy but I do make an attempt to interweave the framework through definitions.  As long as reader appreciates that natural languages have limited abstraction. And be careful with their own imagination, I think this post will somewhat serve the purpose. That said, Gita is experiential. Reading it is analogous to reading about  swimming .  If you knew swimming, reading will help. If you didn't, reading isn't much help.

# `Shraddha` (The Faith - The source of Manifestation)

Faith is a belief that is not based on scientific proof . For example, we don't need faith in Einstein to trust the Theory of Relativity. We don't need faith in Math for it is pure logic. But we need faith in God if we want to believe in him. `Shraddha` is slightly different, for  faith has a tinge of authority. If not full authority at least an equal footing. You have faith in a master or a friend. `Shraddha` is bit more devotional and less demanding. Unlike faith, it can change. Its NOT set in stone. In fact, it changes quite frequently. 
	
> A word on mindless comparisons - Science v/s God- How many of us understand Relativity? Or Quantum Mechanics? But most of us trust science cuz someone else who has seen the scientific proof. Isn't it faith in that someone? That someone could be a teacher, a friend or a book. Another characteristic of this mechanism is that the proof must be  available in open domain.  If we are willing to invest our time, we should be able to verify the proof on our own. But that  isn't that true about spirituality as well ?  Books like Gita and Bible tell us that that there exists something beyond physical.  And we  can find one (ourselves) if we are willing to invest our time. Then where is the conflict ?. Another difference is that science has experimental proofs. So does spirituality. There is proven healing impact of meditation and breathing. People cure and endure through faith. Bottom line - comparisons are misplaced. Don't really serve any purpose. On the contrary, We know for sure that science continuously  evolves . Einstein proved Newton was wrong and later changed his own theory. Quantum Mechanics is still at odds with classical science. Does that mean that we can't have absolute trust in science? Or should we say we have faith in science?

The scripture says humans are made out of `Shraddha`. We are what we believe in. We manifest our faith. The physicality around us is a creation of our faith. As said in chapter 17 verse 3 of Gita.

[Translation](http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/Gita/verse-17-03.html)
The faith of everyone comes according to the perceptions of the mind. The living personality is the embodiment of faith, one is identified by , whatever faith one has. 

Obviously, there is no mathematical proof here but the argument  appears compelling. I see it in my own experiences. And in experiences of many around me. We do science only if we have faith in science. We run if we have faith in running. We live if we have faith in life. In essence, faith is the root. Not the other way around.

	We don't develop faith in things. We develop things because of faith.

# `Atma` (The Unmanifested.)
Gita says `Atma` is something that doesn't die. Fire can't burn it, Water can't wet it. In essence, it is beyond the physical realm. What is it then ? Well `Atma` is NOTHING in physical parlance for it is unmanifested. But it has potential to manifest. In fact, it is the only thing that can manifest. It manifests in line with your `Shraddha`. 

A close comparison would be electricity. Electricity can manifest itself into fans, cars, refrigerators or thousands of other gadgets. Without electricity, they are all dead. We can't dry the current or wet it. Nor can we burn it. It doesn't die or takes birth. Its just there. Motion of electrons is  everywhere but electrons are NOT electricity either.. It sits there unmanifested but has potential to manifest. Unlimited potential. But we can't know electricity by looking at a refrigerator or a fan. Electricity is connected to a common source. It can inter-operate on machines. Same current runs refrigerator as well as fans. It doesn't build gadgets but it is the life in them. You know it is there but you can't see it. It is older than anything you know and it will outlive anything you know. 

	`Atma` shapes your reality based on the `Sharddha` you have. 

# `Bhoota` ( The Manifested - living or dead)
Everything that we see around us, that we can feel with our senses is a `Bhoota`. Gita doesn't differentiate living from non living. Carrying on the example above - A refrigerator is a `Bhoota`. So is a fan. A stone, a mountain , a river , you and me. All are `Bhoota`. 

>In another context, `Bhoota` means past. Which is correct cuz all that is manifested is already in past. `Atma` enables all `Bhootas` and also represents all the possibilities of future. Thus `Atma` is future.

	The purpose of human life is to move from `Bhoota` to `Atma`. That is to disengage from the manifestations and live in potential. 

# `Swadharma` (The nature of `Bhoota`)
Every manifestation, be it living or non-living, has a nature. For example refrigerator has a nature of cooling things. That is what it is made for. Water is supposed to move down. Air spreads in all directions. The designed nature of manifested is called `Swadharma`. We are bound by our `Swadharma`. We can't sway from it even if we wish to. That is the downside of manifested. 
	We are slave to our `Swadharma` (nature)
# `Buddhi` (Intelligence)
`Buddhi` allows to to deviate from `Swadharma`. How much can you deviate ? Very little. No matter how strong your intelligence, it is still miniscule to the complexity of your manifestation. No one can alter `Swadharma` with sheer stroke of Intelligence. But many can understand their nature with intelligence. In Gita, this is called `Atmoupamyen Drishti` - which means our ability to look at us as a third person and analyse our nature. 
	Human life is a gift because of our intelligence. No other living or non-living has this blessing. Some animals may have instances of intelligence but its very limited. 

# `Karma` (The Action of free will)

`Karma` is the action guided by our `Buddhi` that is not controlled by our `Swadhrama`. That means , it is something you do against your nature. Thus Karma manifests something new. In a way, it alters our manifestation. It is because of `Buddhi` (intelligence) , humans could do `Karma` that led to huge change in our manifestation. For example roads, buildings, transportation , communication - all our because of human `Karma`. Building airplanes was NOT human nature. It is because we had intelligence to sway from our `Bhoot swadhrma` (manifested nature). 

>In essence `Karma` is the action of free will . Beyond the slavery of our `Swadharma` (nature) . However though , the window of `Karma` is very small. We are still the same animal at core - built by our manifestation. Depending on what Karma manifests into , Gita defines three types of `Karmas`  - `Satvik` - That leads to internal development and  happiness. `Rajas` - That leads to external growth, conflict and  chase, and lastly `Tamas` - That leads to lust, consumption and lethargy. 


# `Abhyasa` (Practice)

In addition to creating something new, `Karma` has the ability to reshape your own `Swadharma` (nature).  Regular indulgence in `Tamasik Karmas` will make you lethargic and consumer. Similarly `Satvik` Karma will make you interested in pursuit of knowledge and happiness. 

>It appears to an untrained eye that we should indulge in `Satvik Karma`. But Gita says that we want to reach a stage where none of these  are playing. Such karma is called **Nishkam Karma**. This is what leads 'to' ultimate eternal exit from manifestations. 

# `Nishkam` (Without expectations)

`Nishkam Karma` means actions without any expectation. `Satvik` , `Rajas` as well as `Tamas` actions, all have expectations tied to it. In fact anything you do beyond `swadharma` must have a solid incentive for change. Why else would you do it? Thus normally very strong desires lead to `Karma` (good or bad). Accordingly you manifest new stuff and change yourself (good or bad). And manifestations continues to increase in complexity. 

	`Nishkam Karma` (a deed that's neither `Swadhrma` nor done out of any desire) stabilizes the growth. And as proportion of `Nishkam` increases your in your `Swadharma`, manifestation starts gradually receding. This journey from zero `Nishkam` to say 90% Nishkam is called `Nishkam Karm Yoga`. Gita does say that with a living body, you can never attain 100 % `Nishkam Yoga`. Obviously cuz manifestation will cease to exist for you. That stage is normally referred to as `Moksha` - meaning exit from circle of life and death. Important to distingusih `Nishkam Karma` from inaction. Inaction is a `Tamsik Karma`. 

# `Prakriti and Purush`
The complete set of all `Bhootas` , their `Swadharmas` , their `Buddhi` and `Karmas` represent something called `Prakriti`. Generally speaking all that is manifested and its collective nature is `Prakriti`. Complementary to `Prakriti` is `Purush` - the potential at source and sitting in small buckets in all the `Bhootas`. 
	`Prakriti` and `Pusrush` are eternal. Neither is good or bad. There is no beginning or end to their existence. It is the `Maya` that causes all the troubles :-)

>From science standpoint , imagine `Prakriti` as all the observable universe (and multiverses if they exist). And `Purush` as the energy that has potential to  convert into matter. May be dark energy :-). If a universe gets to big crunch , all that is left is energy. Energy converts into matter with big bang. Thus the clever definition by design encompasses everything including nothingness and its claim to eternal perpetuity is quite logical. This rest the constant nagging question - When and How it all started? Why and how it would end ? If we take all these unnecessary questions out of debate, we can get started on to something constructive. Which is how do I fix myself !

# `Maya` (The web of Manifestation )
`Maya` is the complexity of `Prakriti`. When `Prakriti`  grows beyond a certain level, our `Buddhi` is unable to decipher desires from `Nishkam`. Its like a spider caught in its own web. Along with `Kaama` (desires) , `Krodha` (anger) , `Lobha` (greed) , Moha (lust) ; it becomes the fifth sin. 

>A word on web of Maya (Matrix) - Manifestations rarely live in isolation. For example it is as incorrect to say 'God alone created universe' as it would be to say 'Steve Jobs alone created iPhone'. A better way to understand is that Steve had some `Karma` that led to manifestation of an idea. Then Johnny Ive manifested his design onto Steve's idea. Phil Schiller added his marketing machine atop. And thousands of designers, developers, marketers made it a web of manifestation. That is just one product. Imagine this at a universal scale. Imagine there are beings with much greater capacities than  humans. Beings that can manifest stars and planets and galaxies. But never alone. Even for a simple bottle of wine we take help of bacteria. All this mush mush of `Swadharma` and `Karma` leads to an creation. 

# `Khsheta and Kshetragya` (The field and the warrior)

Gita is written for a person who strives to end the misery of `Maya`. `Karmas` (except Nishkam) are essentially driven by desires. All desires during the process of acquisition as well as on fulfillment, lead to misery. 

> A word on desires - Think of desires as addiction. Lets say liquor. An alcoholic strives hard to get his evening fix. Drinks with effort. But next day a hangover hits. Repeated use will lead to destroyed liver. Similarly everything that we are manifesting , including our body, is an addiction. We need more of it. One day, it must end. Process of end has perceived pains. Process of managing our collection is a pain too. Enjoyment must end in sorrow. Love will end in grief. 

Krishna describes the Maya around you as a battlefield `Kshetra`. The battles are not outside in some physical field. We are constantly at battle with in ourselves. One who understand this internal battle field is called `Kshetragya`.
