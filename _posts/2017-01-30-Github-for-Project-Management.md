I have a fairly long career in project management. I started my career as a construction project manager in early 90s and then moved in IT / software project management in 2001. Along the way, I have got exposure to various PMO tools and methodologies with varying degree of expertise. 

People often make a mistake of thinking that a Gantt chart is the only project management tool. In fact, its just one of the several artifacts that a project manager needs to produce and maintain. Some of the key project management artifacts are as below

## Tailoring a Project Methodology 

Depending on your project, you need to fist pick a methodology. Typically for SAP implementations ASAP is the obvious choice though it has lots of limitations that come with a water fall method. For other software projects, Agile is pretty good. But choosing a method is not all, you need to tailor it to meet your project needs. Typically a method will come with huge number of milestones, artifacts and templates. You don't need all of them for your project. Its very important to identify what is needed for your project and make it a formal communication. 

## Setting up a document management process
Documents are key outcome of project. A good document management process, defines the repositories, review and approval process, version management, and long term storage. In many industries (eg Pharmaceuticals) you may be required to keep a hard copy of all documents to meet compliance requirements. 

## Project governance procedures
Some of these will come as a part of methodology but its very important to build and sign off all the project governance procedures early on as part of the project prep phase. Project Charter, Change management process, issue management, Communications process, Technical Architecture, Configuration Management, Source code management, Testing strategy are some of the examples. 

## Project Schedule
Typically Microsoft project is a 'go to' tool for scheduling the project. For very large projects Primevera or SAP project System may be a better choice. These enterprise level tools, allow better financial integration, budget approvals and procurement. For smaller projects Smartsheet offers a built in template that looks like a spreadsheet but has much better collaboration and tracking features. Something like MS project server but lot easier to implement.

## Project progress and status reporting
The key responsibility of a project manager is to track the status of project and communicate up and down to all the stakeholders. Easier said than done :-) Its essential to agree upon on the frequency and format of status reporting. Its always better to set up a biweekly status meeting with project sponsor and key stakeholders. 

## Resource Management 
As a PM, one of the key deliverable is a resource ramp up and ramp down plan. For a software project, manpower is normally the key resource. For an engineering project, you may need a separate plan for equipment a and tools. Software license is another area that might need its own register.

Github can be a handy platform for many of these tasks. For example version and configuration management are inbuilt into git design. It can act as a document repository in addition to your code and media. Issue management features are very well thought of and well integrated with repositories. The best part is offline access to repositories. Your team can fork the repositories for their features or clone them to local computers giving them speed and offline access. It is obviously not the solution for all PMO pains,  but it can sure provide a robust platform for core functions. The only downside is that you need to invest sometime to bring your team up to speed with basic concepts of git and github. I think that's a good investment for project as well as the career of your project team.
