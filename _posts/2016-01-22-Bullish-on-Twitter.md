Though stock has taken a plunge, I am still very bullish on $TWTR. Here is my **sentimental** logic :-)

>Efficiency of network is a measure of how quickly things move through it. 

For example efficient network of roads lets you reach your destination faster. Internet is by design efficient as it routs the packets of information along the route of least resistance.

## Network Connections
Twitter is actually very efficient in spreading the word. Here is the reason.A network should NOT be measured by number of users or number of eyeballs on a specific advertisement. The superiority of the information network is in the number of meaningful connections. Number of meaningful connections determine "How quickly information moves from one place to another. Facebook tries to achieve information dissemination thru intelligent maneuvering of  news feed. Twitter accomplishes the same through vastly more number of connections.

## Leader to Follower
The model "Leader to Follower" has unlimited growth potential. If a leader has a million followers that means a million connections. On the other hand; most other networks follow Facebook's "Friend to Friend" model, which limits the network growth. Twitter, by design, is a place where a leader wants to grow his network. Facebook on the other hand is a place where privacy is the key. Facebook has tried to change its DNA in recent years and there are people with million followers on Facebook  but that is like "a right person in a wrong place".

## Privacy Concerns
Twitter has no privacy concerns cuz everything is open by design. All other networks have privacy issues. As the social media becomes main stream, the privacy issues are going to exponentially increase.

## Identity
Be it a news reader or person getting interviewed. People identify themselves with their Twitter handle. A true transfer of public ID from email to Twitter handle is happening. Have you ever seen someone giving you his phone number or email address anymore on TV?

## Branding
Facebook has recently launched "FB for Work". This is a sure way to make some short term money but once you identify a brand with Work, its going Staples route. Work is Dell, Mac is life.
