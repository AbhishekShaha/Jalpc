The title may confuse you, No this article is not about iron pumping machines. In fact, only exercise I do is running. This is about how I track my fitness. 

> A word about this post: I believe in measurements. To the extent that you can call me crazy. My belief goes a bit further. I think, if we start measuring something religiously, the intended effect automagically starts. For example, if you want to reduce your weight. Just start hopping on the weigh scale three times a day. If you want to improve your steps, just start checking your motion six times a day. The good thing about mobile devices and wearables is that most of the measurements are almost automated. But you still need to look at them. Look at the graphs. Understand the trends. For example, after regular measurements, I found that my wight is around one pound more in the morning. Also that weight loss curve follows a sign curve. So - This post is about what to measure. How and how many times a day. Fitness is just a by product :-) 
> In last couple of years, there has a tsunami of fitness apps. I laud tech companies for bringing so much focus and attention but it has left the average consumer confused. While I cover my measurements tool set, I will also attempt to demystify the health space. 

Lets get started 

# What I measure and Why 

	A little background on my health fanaticism. Two years back I weighed 196 pounds with a pot belly. I used to snore and had constant itching in my ears. But those were lease of my problems. I was tired by the time I reach my work. May be I need a coffee. High doze of sugar in strong coffee used to barely last me till lunch. I had no control on what I ate. Couple of coffees after lunch carried me till four. And that was the time I was shut off. There was spikes of hunger. No workouts. And three four times heavy drinking in a week. I thought it was normal for a mid forties software project manager. I had missed my regular physical two years in a row. Work pressure ! and I was not planning this time either. The only reason I was forced to go to doctor was to ask for a cure for snoring. Thank you wifey. After routine checks, doctor announced that I was diabetic. My A1C was 7.2. At my insistance of not going on a daily pill, he reluctantly believed in my resolve to cure myself with regular exercise and diet control. He didn't miss to ask me show up two months hence. Eight weeks flew by. I didn't change a bit. I even convinced myself that it was pre-diabetes. 

Lets get some work done before we get back to my story. 

## Body mass Index.
Yes good old BMI. That translates directly to your weight if your height is not changing. But still look at BMI. Because there is a healthy weight. You don't want to go negative either.  You need to be between 20 to 22. Anything above 25 is a strict no. For a six feet tall the weight should be 155 pounds (~70 Kilos) . That is simple. Measure weight every month. Okay every week .. NO .. You need to measure at least twice daily. 

As I said above, weight is a sign curve. If you take one measurement in a month , you will need at least two years to build a trend. If you take two measurements a day, you will start seeing a trend with in two weeks. Again, don't worry about weight, worry about BMI. Why, because you need to bench mark your progress with your peers, your friends. Health is a social game. You can't plat it alone. If you communicate in pounds and kilos among your WhatApp groups, your mind has to divide twenty of your friends weight by their heights and than rank them. It will never happen. 

And also, I dare you to record your weight twice daily, calculate BMI and then draw a trend. You will never do it. Thats the reason you need to invest 150 dollars in a digital scale that connects to your smartphone. I use Withings Full Body Analyzer. You can use any. Fitbit Aria is another good at similar price. 

> Just weigh twice and see how your body trends. Believe me, you will start losing weight if thats what you wanted. At least start trending in right direction. The question is how much and how quickly. That is where the tricks play in. First a reminder : You can't reduce weight by exercising hard. There is just no way. Weight loss is possible only through diet control. Why- Our regular diets have just too many calories. Unless you are prepping for Olympics there is no chance.
